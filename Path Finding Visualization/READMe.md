Our project is Path Finding Visualization. This project is a Pathfinding Visualizer, an interactive tool designed to demonstrate how various pathfinding algorithms work in real time. It helps users understand and compare algorithms by visualizing their step-by-step process of exploring nodes and finding the shortest path.We have used
o	Breadth-First Search (BFS)
o	Depth-First Search (DFS)
o	Dijkstra’s Algorithm
o	Greedy Best-First Search
o	A* Search
We also used 5 different algorithm for Maze generation 
o	Recursive Division
o	Prim’s Algorithm
o	Randomised DFS
o	Basic Random Maze
o	Basic Weight Maze
