Our project Path Finding Visualization. This project is a Pathfinding Visualizer, an interactive tool designed to demonstrate
how various pathfinding algorithms work in real time. It helps users understand and compare algorithms by visualizing their
step-by-step process of exploring nodes and finding the shortest path.We have used Greedy Best First Search,Depth First Search A* Search, Breadth First Search and Dijkstra's Search algorithm here.
