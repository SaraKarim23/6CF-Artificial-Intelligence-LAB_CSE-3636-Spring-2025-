Our project is Path Finding Visualization. This project is a Pathfinding Visualizer, an interactive tool designed to demonstrate how various pathfinding algorithms work in real time. It helps users understand and compare algorithms by visualizing their step-by-step process of exploring nodes and finding the shortest path.
Breadth-First Search (BFS),	Depth-First Search (DFS),	Dijkstra’s Algorithm,	Greedy Best-First Search &	A* Search- algorithms are used for path finding.
We also used 5 different algorithm for Maze generation -	Recursive Division,	Prim’s Algorithm,	Randomised DFS,	Basic Random Maze &	Basic Weight Maze.
